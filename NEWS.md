# News for Microbiome.jl

## v0.3.0

Major changes:
- Dropped support for julia-0.6, moved on to julia-0.7
- Moved Plotting and BioBakery utilities out to separate packages to reduce dependencies
    - These two new packages will be released shortly
- I'm keeping DataFrames dependency for now, though I'd like to move to IterableTables soonish (though constructors might be more sense in EcoBase)

## Older versions

I didn't have NEWS.md until v0.3. I doubt anyone cares, but I kinda tried to
keep track in release notes.
